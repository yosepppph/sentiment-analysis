"Is there any way we can purchase the distance/gesture sensor by itself, or even in a pack of 2+? I really have no use for the LED matrix, thus why I did not upgrade to that bundle. It would have just been a waste of money for me, but I would love to get a few of the sensor boards.",2
"Any chance of programming this with the Arduino IDE  (?) I know that Adafruit has a board core for the Micro:BIT which works quite well - thou a it is a little picky to setup the first time. really like the hardware you have produced, but I don't like the programming environment at all.  I'm not sure how hard it would be to port/chance what Adafruit has done, but it might be worth a look for some of us advance users or for people who don't like the programming environment.",2
What is the difficulty with setting up your robot for someone with no experience at all? Could you briefly elaborate on the setup. Also does the app work with android users? Thank you!,2
Will there be different languages for the software ? I would give this as a present to a child but that could be a problem when it comes to English :),2
Also would love some more info on the distance/gesture board and what can be done with it.,1
"Is there any more information on the distance/gesture board? I'm interested, but I'm not entirely sold since the jump from the Super Early Bird pledge to the Early Bird Genius Kit pledge is å£28.",1
Well my three daughters should have a ball with that they loved their å£5 robots,1
"Awesome work, Ross and team! Looking forward to seeing Smartibot in action.",1
What are the minimal requirements for the app?Rather than putting my iPhone X on a moving thing (which is a scary idea)I want to know if I can use my old 5s (which doesn't have AI chips) for this.Thx,0
This is great!  Perfect Christmas present.  I added å£ 25 to my pledge for the Precious kit to get the LED/sensor board per your earlier response to a comment...is that ok?,1
This looks fantastic! I can‰Ûªt wait to start 3D printing bodies for it!,1
This project rocks! Can‰Ûªt wait to play _ÙÕ__ÙÕ__ÙÕ_,1
"Besides, the description of each team members are interesting. *thumbs up*",1
Can you elaborate about the Precious Kit? Why there is no exclusive cloth patch for the Precious Kit?,2
"Also backed before I even watched the video, keep up the brilliant work you good, good people!",1
Backed without blinking. Genius kit because of the display and all. No (super) early bird surprises there either? In it for the bots so happy regardless. :),1
Wow. This sounds like an awesome base for my STEM class at school. ,1
"I've made a pledge of $1, for which I'd like to see Titan's real performance underwater after the crowd-funding based on feedback. I do have confidence in Titan, and believe it would be perfect for underwater exploreres and photographers!",1
"How will the titan be charged?  Do the drone and wifi transmitter use the same charger? I'm in Australia and we use 230-240AC ,will I have to buy an adapter or have you already thought of this?Thanks to titan's team.",2
Water scooter!That's cool.I hope to see it soon.,1
"Actually, I've used a ROV for fishing,But I have to say that it is more difficult to control than DJI's drones.I've been watching your videos,It looks like Titan is doing well underwater.I hope I can control it easily.",1
Just wondering if you could give us an update on the current timeline for distribution of the Titan please. On the 7th June under these comments you said that all Kickstarter Titans would be sent out in August.Under the project timeline in Kickstarter it says that they‰Ûªll be sent out in October.An update on your current progress for distribution would be appreciated.Thankyou,2
"I am a diver, and I believe titan will be a surprise product.I want to know if it can drag underwater divers to stealth underwater.",1
"After careful consideration and comparison, I chose titan.I hope it will help me search for nearby lakes.",1
"with the accessory extension port, will I be able to use the pins to create my own accessories or do have to only use pre-made ones when they become available?",2
"After carefully considering a number of options, I've finally decided to be a backer for the Titan and look forward to watching the project come to life. (I'm very excited!!!!) I do have a few questions please:-(1) What is the maximum size tablet that will fit the remote controller?(2) I have requested the optional 150 meter tether. Will it come with a reel like the Poseidon has to assist winding the cable on?(3) Will the Titan use the ""geneROV"" app that is used for the Poseidon or will the Titan have its own app?(4) One of the competitors is boasting that they have the best stabilised underwater drone.With the Titans 6 propellers I would hope that it also has excellent stabilising characteristics. Just interested in any comments you have about achieving stabilisation with the Titan.ThankyouPeter",1
"The best would be to sway, it only needs to do it slowly, its for hull, dock or quayside inspection, maybe a small thruster under the Titan connected to the extension port as an option? The tilt function is allready perfect for inspections. Thanks!",0
"Hi, awesome drone you made! I will be using it for underwater inspection and my question is, would it be possible to move the Titan also sideways at a fixed depth and heading, maybe with an extra thruster under the Titan? Thanks! Cheers, Roald",1
"Good Morning. You sent me the package size, but I'd like to know the size of the case. Excuse me, but it's very important. Thank you.",3
"Good Morning. I would like to know if the invoice can only contain the price of the device, without the cost of shipping? Thank you very much.",2
"Could you provide us ""the pins"" of the superior connection?",2
"Dear friends. Would you like to know the measures of the suitcase or sheel coming TITAN, if it fits in the passenger cabin of a regular flight aircraft? This measure will outline my strategy for receiving TITAN. Because in the basement of the planes, the suitcases are very badly treated and sometimes violated. It's very important. As you would ask to deliver the TITAN in the USA and not in BrazilT hank you!",2
"Its not particulary important, but i can imagine that sometimes it would be nice to have a waterproof surfce/controll unit. than i could use a PC built in to a waterproof case with joysticks. But it is probably very nice to use a phone or tablet, because it is very easy to use and bring.",2
Will it be possible to control from a computer?,2
"In reference to my previous msg, I prefer that it be sent by state mail, not by private courier, for reasons of tax increase. By state post office the taxes are much lower .. Very fought for your helpful attention.",3
"Hi, can you please give more information regarding the extension port at the bottom and the robot arm? How much will the robot arm cost? How do we operate the arm while also controlling the titan? What the spec of the arm?",2
"Boa noite. I would like to know if the shipment to Brazil (Latin America) would be by the United States Postal Service, or other private courier company? Than you.",3
"Hello,May I ask..Is it possible to control during diving with me?",2
Can any VR goggles be used with the titan? If not where can i get Geneinno VR goggles?,2
"Hi, also just wondering how does the weight work? Does the weight depend on how deep you want to dive?",2
"Hi, just wondering how strong is the cable and the cable connection to the drone? Worst case scenario is if the drone got stuck on some seaweed. Can you use the cable to pull it out?",2
"Could you do a 150m tether update last day or behind August, please?",2
"I have a Poseidon 1 currently and love it.  I have 150m tether for it, question I have is will the it work with the Titan?",2
This is all of my Super Anthony videos from the Kansas City Maker Faire:,3
" , Is the Robot open source? What is the programming interface?",2
Me and and my Super Anthony will be at the Kansas City Maker Faire June 23 and 24. If you want to see the robot in person. I am hoping to start a robot boxing league in the US. I think the KC Maker Faire would be a great venue for an annual event.,2
"Why were is no super early bird for the double pack?One robot alone is quite boring, but the pack is very interesting...",2
I am pretty super I approve of this project.,1
This is the best video I have from #Robogames 2018 where I won bronze in Kungfu. I wish the video was better!,1
  just backed. I know there must be delays in Kickstarter projects (everyone knows) but please keep us up to date about it. From the video it seems Super Anthony is close to complete. I have high hopes. Can't wait to play with this little monster. Nice work guys.,1
"Heck yea, finally a kickass robot!!   I wanna see him fighting another bot",1
" Well, it'll be two months tomorrow, since last comment about any progress/updates",2
Still waiting on camera replacement/redesign news and progress on project completion,2
Well it's been a month.... any updates or news or progress,2
Can you have 1 or more lessons about how the camera data is processed? How is it read? How is it processed / analyzed?,2
"Adafruit has a spy camera that's Arduino, The RPI Compute module can  have 2 RPi cameras and 2 displays, These were examples since you indicate that the RPi can be used and has multiple usb ports. I know these use a separate carrier IO board for the camera itself...",2
"Today's update greatly saddens me... more delays. Will the processor upgrade also cause further delays as well? There are so many cameras available in many form factors, I can't believe that they are all not compatible with this main board. have you looked at Adafruits or Raspberry Pi offerings.",0
"Hello everyone! We've posted our latest update, including information on shipping estimates.",3
I'm checking and sweating for these updates. Getting real thirsty. lol,2
Would definitely like an update I have school personnel asking me daily and I have no answers.  Even if it is a delay...need to know something pretty please. :-),2
I hope the next update will cover about delivery and shipping date,2
"May is just around the corner. How is manufacturing of body parts, servos, electronics and camera moving along?",2
"Asada: No major updates since a couple weeks agoSrinivas: No estimated delays yet, still working with the camera manufacturereCasio: Yes, B+, sorry about that.",2
Would you update us please?,2
I understand that this project is experiencing delays . I would to  know the targeted shipping date for Hubert kit .,3
"Hello guys,Raspberry 3 B+ is the latest board,not  Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.I hope this is a type error.",2
No survey yet - we'll be sure to both email you and post an update when we send out the survey.,2
"Hi, just random thoughts cause I backed this in sep 2017. Have we received a survey for Hubert delivery? Sorry because it was a while ago and I get a lot of mails daily",2
Thank you for the promising news,1
Havent seen any updates on manufacturing and progress for passed 2 months,0
"I know we fell short on the 100k stretch goal for a smartphone app, but I was hoping that it would be available separately as an add on. It would make on the fly customization and programming so much easier. What‰Ûªs the plan around an app?",0
Thanks for the reply. I am counting my current budget to see if I can make a pledge.  Cheers,1
"ArcBotics: Would you consider a pledge level to gain access to your training/tutorial system... without the robot?  I know, sounds unhelpful, but if the software training (of the humans) is what the project is partly about as an end goal, it seems fair to have a virtual Hubert as a possibility?",2
"Hi, I'm long so currently my backing tier is early bird special (799$) can I extra 49$ to the current amount to get an extra cerebellum board? Also, will the cerebellum board could work with hexapod 2.0? Could you give us some hints or teasers about hexapod 2.0? (when?) thank you very much  :PPPP",2
  Edwards:The robot in the video is a prototype. We'll be polishing it up further and refining for manufacturing before we ship. We'll post updates of the progress as we do so.,2
"Wow this is amazing! As a company centered around the development of autonomous technology, we may be in contact soon about future projects! This is groundbreaking good job and congrats!",1
 : THANK YOU!  Your comment really made our morning :),1
I'm backing this and I'll be taking some vacation time when it ships out. Very excited!!! My work might be impacted.,1
"   It's a very widely available 9g micro servo compatible with tower pro. Ebay is often easiest for sourcing these and they're pretty cheap. You can do a search on your local ebay for ""towerpro 9g micro servo"" and you should find lots of sellers. Let me know if you have any problems finding one.Cheers,Ben",2
"Hi Ben, I got the servo busted during assembly, could you give me some information about the servo so I can buy a replacement?",2
"@ Dennis - very happy to hear you enjoyed the v1! For spirograph type drawings it's quite simple with what you already have. You just need to put a repeat loop around the shape you're drawing and do something like make it turn a degree once per loop and it will draw the same pattern over and over with a slight change each time. In pseudo-code, something like this:",1
"Mr. Pirt;  I purchased your mirobot1 and am on the list for mirobot2.  I am a bit slow, but I just got around to building the Mirobot1 today.  It is very nice.  When I ordered it, I wasn't really sure what i would get, but I figured it would help my daughter to possibly understand a little bit of programming.  And I think it will do that.  She helped me build it today.  We were able to get it to draw a few lines, and move around, etc.  I believe it is worth what I spent and my daughter is very excited about it.",1
"I'm not sure how long it takes to get a reply on the Google groups. As yet someone has allowed me to join and 3 people ahve viewed my question, btu no reply.",2
I tried to join the Google group and am still waiting to be 'allowed in'...I own a mirobot and need to ask questions regarding which network is meant. I connected it to my in-house wifi but now I am wondering if you meant my computer network as it has not given me a different IP?? The instructions are quite vague. Please help!!!,2
"Hi Seyha,There's a good, active support forum over at Google Groups ( https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mirobot ) - please could you (or anyone else looking for support and reading this) ask your question over there as that's a better place than Kickstarter comments.All the best,Ben",2
can anyone help me? is anyone done assembly and run it yet? I assembly everything look good turn it on and connect Mirobot to my laptop open when i put code in it is not moving but for pen down and up i can hear sound but dont do anything please help thanks,2
"I'll throw in a similar comment as others.  I got mine today and the packaging was very nicely done.  Look forward to putting this together and checking it out for myself, err, my boys! ;-)",1
"Got my kit a few days ago, soldered and put it together with the kids. It's their favorite robot so far. Well done!",1
"I received mine yesterday. (Boston, MA). I have not opened it yet. Thanks for running a great kickstarter.",1
"Got mine in Germany today. It a great packaging and a cool design. I can't wait to assemble and test... ;-)Great Job, Ben!",1
"Just received it in Belgium :D Thanks you, it is cleverly packed, good work. I'll built it asap.",1
"Hello,I received my kit 2 days ago in France and built the chassis yesterday.It's a good and simple kit but be very very careful when you fix the antenna on the antenna mount, i broke it!Some pins of the chip sockets and of the stepper driver were bent but i was able to unbend them with much care.Thanks a lot for this new toy ;-)",1
"Arrived last week, built over the weekend. Its an awesome little kit. The firmware update util updated the UI code but didn't appear to recognise the arduino code version and the mismatch seemed to result in a lot of ""reconnecting"" errors, after updating the arduino via serial (You need to remove the arduino from the socket or you'll get timeouts when trying to upload) everything seemed to be back in sync and its all operating nicely. The upgrade util now reports everything up to date and there's extra buttons in the UI for the sensors.",1
"Salut,just to let you know that my regular kit has arrived in Germany on Friday, November 14th. The new package looks great - unfortunately no time this weekend to build it ...Ciao, Mathias",1
"No glue required! One of the main features of the design is that it is easy to put together _and_ take apart because if kids are building it then if mistakes are made they should be easy to fix. Also, schools can assemble one Mirobot multiple times with different children.",1
"Hi, For build all part i must use the glue?",2
See Update 10 for timeline updates: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bjpirt/mirobot-the-diy-wifi-robot-for-children/posts/954676,2
any update for the regular kits?,2
"Hi Tom,I'll have some kits available at Brighton but they will be the extras from the Early Bird backing level and won't come with the addons. As I said in the last update, if you need your Mirobot early and don't need the addons then I can send you one of these (although they are pretty limited!). In any case come and say hi (that goes for anyone else who's there)Cheers,Ben",2
"Ben, I'm going to Brighton Maker Faire this weekend if you have any kits ready?",2
"Got mine in Melbourne Australia, looking forward to putting it together!",1
"Thanks again Mathias! I'm very glad you feel your money has been well spent. I know with Kickstarter there's always a bit of doubt you're going to get anything until you actually get it, but I'm hoping you'll all be really pleased with Mirobot. As I said int he previous comment, the PCB just got a lot simpler to make and the most recent thing I've been working on is on making the packaging slick - a blog post should be up shortly.",1
"Salut to all backers,I forgot to mention that the chassis built went well and the robot is working. I found a couple of suggestions that I reported back to Ben for improvement and the final product is probably excellent. Following what I have as beta tester in hand, our money is well spent.",1
"Salut to all backers,I received my beta package on Wednesday but had no time before today to start building it. As an interim update: I soldered the PCB. This is easy and took me about 20 minutes. No issue so far, the board came up as planned, servo OK, wifi ""mirobot"" visible. I will now start building the chassis. Overall first impression: looks like a beautiful project we backed here!Ciao, Mathias",1
Very cool.  Thank you for the update!,1
"Good day, Ben!  Just wanted to stop by and see how things are coming along with the Mirobot?",2
Thanks everyone for the congratulations!,1
Congratulations!Love the blog. Maybe you could include some tips for soldering with kids (or for those with little or no experience.,1
"Congratulations Ben, I've told you about 500%, haven't I :-)Well, if you are in Brussels by any chance drop me a line, we are going to celebrate it with a Belgian beer!",1
Congratulations on the successful campaign!  I am looking forward to teach my boys more about robotics and programming through this!,1
  - thank you - that's fine about the extra units - thanks so much for backing!,1
"Good luck on the final hour Ben! Would be nice to see you get 500 backers, I've reshared the project around a bit. Well done on smashing all your goals so far!",1
"Ben - I'm sitting in the cafe at the Royal Institution with two friends: showed them Mirobot and they both said ""I want one!"". Have upped my pledge ‰ÛÒ can I make that for three units, please?",1
"Yay! Congratulations, Ben!",1
"Well done on passing å£25,000 beep beep beep",1
We still looking good for next goal :),2
"  I'm glad you like Mirobot! Interesting to hear about your turtle - which one did you buy? I'm still on the lookout for one of the plexiglass dome ones.Because Mirobot is already open source, all of the software is already available to download from Github. At the moment it's all a bit tied to the hardware and there's no simulator yet but as I develop everything you'll be able to see it there.",2
"  that's great to hear - yes, if you increase your bid I'll send out moreThanks for backing,Ben",1
"Hi, brilliant project. I'd like to order a couple of additional Mirobots for some friends' kids. Can I just increase my pledge do to that?",1
"Hello Nous Team, and congrats for a great project! I too am an advocate for spreading access to tech to underserved community! I‰Ûªd love to back a Bucky or even a classroom kit, but I failed to find details on software compatibility. And I‰Ûªm using RaspberryPi computer within my kids makerspace, as I haven‰Ûªt  gathered enough funding for tablets and want to share an open-source spirit in the kid‰Ûªs mind and habits. What platform is your software compatible with? What os/iOS, browser? Will it work online within Google Chrome web browser for instance? Do you plan on extending compatibility later on and develop a Pi-compatible version? Will your software be open-source? Will Bucky be programmable with mBlock? Arduino? Other open source ressources? You might want to look into those possible developments to broader the access to Bucky on low income community. Big up and good luck for the rest of the adventure...",1
